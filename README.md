Initially forked fom http://www.github.com/dcdeiv/jsonslider

However after some exploration, our need to load in a large number of images without overloading the DOM with hidden ```<img>``` tags led to a complete rewrite & fresh project

This code has only been tested on recent Chrome. YMMV, however some of the effects are unlikely to work in non-webkit browsers without modification.
